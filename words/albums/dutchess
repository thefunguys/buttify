Oh! It's me, Fergie
The pimp, Polow!
Fergie Ferg, what's up baby?
Come on!

When I come to the club step aside

Part the seas, don't be havin' me in the line

V.I.P. ~cause you know I gotta shine

I'm Fergie Ferg and me love you long time


All my girls get down on the floor

Back to back, drop it down real low

I'm such a lady but I'm dancin' like a ho

~Cause you know I don't give a fuck, so here we go!

Everybody start lookin' real good
  

That Grey Goose got your girl feelin' loose
Now I'm wishin' that I didn't wear these shoes
It's like e'ry time I get up on a dude
Paparazzi put my business in the news

And I'm like, Get up out my face!

~Fore I turn around and spray your ass with mace!

My lips make you want to have a taste

You got that? I got the bass


How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna go down like
London London London, wanna go down like
London London London, we goin' down like

How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna go down like

Another ATL Cali collabo

When I come to the club step aside

Part the seas, don't be havin' me in the line

V.I.P. ~cause you know I gotta shine

I'm Fergie Ferg and me love you long time


All my girls get down on the floor

Back to back, drop it down real low

Shittin' on the world
Fuck you bitches!
Baby, baby when you're looking deep in my eyes
I know you're seeing past my make up
Into the little girl that used to hide out and cry
When her parents fought, tryin' to be strong

You can see the hurt in me, the cover ups so secretly
And all that I aspire to be, you see, you see
You know who I really am, no entourage or caravan
And do you even give a damn, about all that and tell me

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want grow older with
Baby, I'll give you all that I got

See, I don't mean to scare you now or push you away
'Cause I'm not tryin' to rush anything
But when I look into your eyes I'm not scared to say
I'll sit near you, I'm in the picture too

Like a happy family tree, we're together constantly
This could be eventually, we'll see, we'll see
But all that I have got to know is with me baby will you grow
Through sun and rain and heavy snow, oh, tell me so now, baby

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want grow older with
Baby, I'll give you all that I got

It's as simple as one and two, I'm in love with you
And three and four, you're all I adore
To the seven and eight, see I've been making mistakes
'Cause when you're on my mind I just can't think straight

Back to the five and six, I'm all in the mix
And I'm all into you Without the lipstick
Without the L'Oreal you remain the same, angel
That I fell for, for real, for real

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want grow older with
Baby, I'll give you all that I got

I'll give you all that I got

Don't let aah, yeah
Da, da, da, da, da, da

I just wanna be close to you

The way you look in the morning
I can see your face and your daze
The way

Your silence
Always has so to say, to say
With you my king is where I belong
Our castle is beautiful and strong

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you

How you own this body
Smoke your cigarette
Sing to me in bed the way

You hold me like you're protecting your throne
I'll be your queen we'll fit so well
Yet near me darling is where dwell

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you

You say I'm talking and laughing I'm not
Breakfast in bed, have a play pillow fight
We'll hang like homies 'cause you're best friend
I know I'm safe just as long as I feel your skin

Not that I need I'm secure with myself
Space, trust, and respect I understand well
Baby, I just see such beauty in you
That I need is being close too
If near me, darling, is where you dwell

I wanna be close to you, you, you, you
I just wanna be close to you


Da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, dat

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
Lately, I don't know
But somethings coming over me
Thoughts of stirring up
'Bout stirring up a drink or three

I'm down to go where the wind blows
So come and follow
Don't wanna leave ya, babe, leave ya, babe
So please, baby

We could fly
Up, up, up, up high
Blue sky
Up, up, up, up high

Feel the high
Come and take ride
Above the stars were going far

If you wanted to have a party
Come on everybody put down your latte
Throw your work aside and come to
Paradise

No frustration on this vacation
This destination, this correlation
No consolation, only sensation
Paradise

Where the water is so clear
That you can see your feet
Dropping coins
In my nature by the coral reef

In every natural treasures
From mother nature
We are so wealthy now, wealthy now
Tell me now

Say goodbye
Buh, buh, buh, buh-bye
To all the tries
Buh, buh, buh, buh-bye

Relax your mind
Open up a wine

And then explore
I'll show you more

If you wanted to have a party
Come on everybody put down your latte
Throw your work aside and come to
Paradise

No frustration on this vacation
This destination, this correlation
No consolation, only sensation
Paradise

If you wanted to have a party
Come on everybody put down your latte
Throw your work aside and come to
Paradise

No frustration on this vacation
This destination, this correlation
No consolation, only sensation
Paradise

If you wanted to have a party

Throw your work aside and come to
Paradise

No frustration on this vacation
This destination, this correlation
No consolation, only sensation

Why do I keep biting on the edge of my chin?
It feels so good to have a taste of what I'm crawling in

I got to go, I got to lead the way
The chains of today, are pulling me
Even though I thought things over in my head
On if I'd stay, it's another ticket to your next game

Wake up, wake up now, wake up, wake up

Shake up, shake up, now breakup, breakup

I know your little plans

Would you see me when you stop winning?
So wake up, wake up now, wake up, wake up
'Cause I just got you back

Why did you keep talking out two sides of your mouth?
You didn't think I'd hear from people, hi, you're selling out
What did you think, making your deals that I couldn't keep up?
Manipulative, calculative, I bet you thought

I didn't know, I couldn't see
The spade displayed your plan for using me
You'd better bet your counterfeit, it's time to say goodnight
It's another reason to say, goodbye, goodbye, Buh-bye

Is my take a ride
It's I'm to make a ride

Maybe we can take a ride
Maybe we can take a long ride
Ever since I was a baby girl I had a dream
Cinderella theme, crazy as it seems
Always knew that deep inside that there would come a day
When I would have to way, make so many mistakes

I couldn't comprehend as I watched it unfold
This classic story told I left it in the cold
Walking through an open door that led me back to you
Each one unlocking more of the truth

I finally stopped tripping on my youth
I finally got lost inside of you
I finally know that I needed to grow
And finally my maze has been solved

Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though it will have a different set
Something strange and new is happening

Finally
Now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him finally

I remember the beginning you already knew
I acted like a fool, just trying to be cool
Fronting like it didn't matter, I just ran away
On another face, was lost in my own space

Found what it's like to hurt selfishly
Scared to give of me, afraid to just believe
I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place
Stumbled through the nets that I had made

Finally got out of my own way
I've finally started living for today
I finally know, I needed to grow
And finally know that it must be so

Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though we will have a different set
Something strange and new is happening

Finally
Now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Gave my love to him finally

Finally, finally

Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though it will have a different set
Something beautiful is happening, is happening

Finally
Now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him finally

Oh, finally, finally, finally
Don't know what day it is
What's going on?
Is this real?
Oh no, no, no, no, no

I woke up short of breath
But I've still got a long day ahead of me
I don't know what day it is
But tell me 'cause I gotta know who to be

Is that me up in the mirror?
'Cause I thought it was somebody else
Well, it's a realization, when you find out
You don't even wanna look at yourself

Where do I go? What do I do?
Who do I turn to? I'm losing my ground
Who am I now? Where does it end?
How did it all begin? I'm losing my ground

Well, hit my feet, it time to hit the streets
And get my life back together again
Well, this place is all a masquerade
So tell me where in line can I cut in?

Downtown wandering aimlessly around
Still don't know what I'm tryin' to find
Well, you could flash all the pretty lights
In front of me, I still won't see the signs

Where do I go? What do I do?
Who do I turn to? I'm losing my ground
Who am I now? Where does it end?
How did it all begin? I'm losing my ground

Ground, losing my
I'm losing my
I'm losing my ground

Losing my, losing my
Losing my ground

Why do I do this to myself?
I'm losing my, why do I do?
Why do I do? Why do I do?

Where do I go? What do I do?
Who do I turn to? I'm loosing my ground
Who am I now? Where does it end?
How did it all begin? I'm losing my ground

Ground, I'm losing my
I'm losing my
I'm losing my ground
It's cold outside, why don't you come in?
I know, my walls are crumbling
It's late at night and lately I've been alone
But that could be changing

What you do to me, conjures up feelings
I've never felt before and your company I adore
So deliciously, gold and burgundy
Sink into me I feel so warm

I feel you, I taste you
The smoothest wine
Like velvet, can't help it
This love's divine

The moon is full, the stars are aligned
I know, just look into my eyes
It's beautiful, your skin against mine
I hope, you let your mind take flight

Under velvet skies, lover, we can fly
Away from the world, let all of our love unfurl
What a gorgeous ride, you don't have to hide
A thing from me, I am your girl

I feel you, I taste you
The smoothest wine
Like velvet, can't help it
This love's divine

I'm ready to feel you, slowly we escape
Our time we can take, we can take, we can take
I'm ready to feel you, feel you, feel you
Feel you, feel you, feel

I feel you, I taste you
The smoothest wine
Like velvet, can't help it
This love's divine

I feel you, I taste you
The smoothest wine
Like velvet, can't help it
This love's divine
Four, tres, two, uno

G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yeah
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S

We flyin' first class up in the sky
Poppin' champagne, livin' my life
In the fast lane, I won't change
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy

The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous
  
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous
  
By the glamorous, ooh the flossy flossy

Wear them gold and diamonds rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperons and limousines
Shopping for expensive things

I be on the movie screens
Magazines and boogie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine

I still go to Taco Bell
Drive through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell

After the show or after the Grammys
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin', reminiscing on days
When I had a Mustang and now I'm in

First class up in the sky
Poppin' champagne, livin' my life
In the fast lane, I won't change
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy

The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous
  
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy
The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous
  
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy

I'm talking champagne wishes, caviar dreams
You deserve nothing but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue what to do with us
I got enough money in the bank for the two of us

Plus I gotta keep enough lettuce to support your shoe fetish
Lifestyles so rich and famous, Robin Leach'll get jealous
Half a million for the stones, takin' trips from here to Rome
So if you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home

G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yes
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S

We flyin' first class up in the sky
Poppin' champagne, livin' my life
In the fast lane, I won't change
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy

The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous
  
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy
The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous
  
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy

I got problems up to here, I got people in my ear
Tellin' me these crazy things that I don't want to know

I got money in the bank and I'd really like to thank
All the fans, I'd like to thank, thank you really though

'Cause I remember yesterday when I dreamt about the days
When I'd rock on MTV, that'd be really dope
Damn, it's been a long road and the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know

  
My daddy told me so
  
He let his daughter know
  
My daddy told me so
  
He let his daughter know
The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
To be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

The path that I'm walkin', I must go alone
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full grown, full grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Like the little school mate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and Uno cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be mine
Valentine

Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers
And share our secret worlds

But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late, dark outside
I need to be with myself, and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it

First time that I saw your eyes
Boy, you looked right through me
Play it cool but I knew you knew
That cupid hit me

You got me trippin', stumblin', flippin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin in love
You got me slippin', tumblin', sinkin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love, so in love with you

Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it

Can't breath when you touch me, see
Butterflies so crazy
Whoa now, think I'm goin' down
Friends don't know what's with me

You got me trippin', stumblin', flippin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love
You got me slippin', tumblin', sinkin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love, so in love with you

She can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it

You know this ain't the first time
This has happened to me, this love sick thing
I like serious relationships
And a girl like me don't stay single for long

'Cause every time a boyfriend and I break up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug crawls right back up
And bites me and I'm back

Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it

Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it

You got me trippin', stumblin', flippin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love
You got me slippin', tumblin', sinkin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love, so in love with you

Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love
You got me slippin', tumblin', sinkin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
The smell of your skin lingers on me now

Your pedestal is falling down
Falling down, falling down
Your pedestal is falling down
Da, da, da, da, da, da

Record sales are on the mark
'Cause that's about the time the rumors start
Where all the people talking out their ass
Well, someone gotta school ya 'cause ya got no class

Well, I've paid my dues, I'm a seasoned dame
So why you gotta throw salt in my game
You hide behind the computer screens
So that you don't have to be seen
How could a person be so mean?

Who are you and what do you do?
That makes you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes

The pedestal, you put yourself on
Well, since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Probably one of them tag a longs down
For the free T-shirt 'cause you're a hanger on
You think you got my figured out
Never met me have no clue what I'm about

Maybe I got things you wish you had
You need to stop the hate and get a pen and pad
I work around the clock, so fill your smoth up with a sock
And get you head up off your jock

Tell me who you are and what your background is?
Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this?

Who are you and what do you do?
That makes you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes

The pedestal, you put yourself on
Well, since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone, gone

Your pedestal is falling down
Falling down, falling down
Your pedestal is falling down
Dum, dum, dum, dum

Your pedestal is falling down
Falling down, falling down
Your pedestal is falling down
Da, da, da, da, da, da

Tell me who you are and what your background is?
Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this?
You think I don't see you on the Internet
I've read it, don't think I won't forget

Who are you and what do you do?
That makes you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes

The pedestal, you put yourself on
Well, since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone, gone

Who are you and what do you do?
That makes you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes

The pedestal, you put yourself on
Well, since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone, gone
When I wear my Mary Jane's shoes
I can escape from a blues
The whole world seems a little bit brighter, brighter
My heavy steps get a little bit louder, louder

Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's

When I wear my Mary Jane's shoes
Just like a child under bruise
My heart and my soul they feel like I'm seven
But from my head to my toes it's like I'm in heaven, heaven

Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's, oh, no, oh, no
Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's, oh, no, oh, no

When I wear Mary Jane's shoes
I enjoy to spin the ones and twos
Music has another dimension
And I can dance with different perception

Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's, oh, no, oh, no
Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's, oh, no, oh, no

When I step into my shoes
Make the lady wanna
Really high, really low
Is caught up in the bubble

Everything is beautiful
Motherfucking, really great
When I step into my shoes
Make the lady wanna go crazy

Wanna go crazy
Wanna go crazy
Wanna go crazy

Whoa, my Mary Jane
Whoa, my Mary Jane
Whoa, my Mary Jane
Whoa, my Mary Jane
Whoa, my Mary Jane
The devil comes and I, I try to stall and I
Soon my subconscious and conscious might start to brawl
And I put up my walls, and I, and they begin to fall
As this cunning demon takes me as it voodoo doll and I

Darkness sets in as the horns start to grow
Suddenly I become somebody I don't know

Whoa, what do I do? This body's a temple of doom
Whoa, what can I say? To, oh, make all of this go away

I got many different names, but to you it's all the same
I be the crawlin' in your skin, I be the reason for your sin
I be the cunning in your charm and I be the needle in your arm
Call me once might let you got but call me twice and then
I'm gonna get ya

Mind playin' tricks on me, I'm paranoid, homie
Nobody know what I'm going through God, I'm so lonely
I know I'm loosin' it, I'm hearing, whispering
Somebody's watching me, clockin' me, hear my heart tickin'

Worshiping two Gods can get you in deep
Crystal ball show you things you're not supposed to see

Whoa, what do I do? This body's a temple of doom
Whoa, what can I say? To, oh, make all of this go away

You know I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, I'm gonna get ya
You know I'm comin' for ya, you see I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, I'm gonna get ya

You know I'm comin' for ya, you see I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, I'm gonna get ya
You know I'm comin' for ya, you see I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, I'm gonna get ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Ain't nobody rock it like this
Ain't nobody out there swift like this
Everywhere I go all I hear is this
Yes, I must confess

And it's true we keeps it fresh
'Cause keepin' it fresh is my main interest
Just stayin' consistent, givin' them hits
Can't hate on this

So hate if you wanna wanna
'Cause that ain't gon' make me wanna
Go stop what I'm doin' to you
Come and my beat go boom, boom

In the club they be jumpin', jumpin'
To the base that's like pumpin', pumpin'
And the girls like the speakers thumpin'
'Cause I told them to shake their humps

And any minute I'll be rollin' through
So get ready, so get ready
And any minute I'll be comin' through
So get ready, so get ready

'Cause here I come, get ready 'cause here I come

Get ready 'cause here I come

Get ready 'cause here I come
Get ready 'cause here I come

Ain't nobody rip it like me
F to the E R G I E
I rock it hardcore for my fly ladies
I rock it, yes indeed

I represent Los Angeles city
Hacienda Heights is the vicinity
Old school homies still rollin' with me
Money don't change me

So hate if you gotta, gotta
'Cause I got a lotta, lotta
Fans that I holla, holla
I'm making it hot

In the club they be jumpin', jumpin'
To the base that's like pumpin', pumpin'
And the girls like the speakers thumpin'
'Cause I told them to shake their humps

Oh, and any minute I'll be rollin' through
So get ready, so get ready
And any minute I'll be comin' through
So get ready, so get ready

'Cause here I come, get ready 'cause here I come

Get ready 'cause here I come

Get ready 'cause here I come
Get ready 'cause here I come

Will.i.am steppin' in just like a gentleman
Dressed to impress just to mess with them femines
buy you long island but my name ain't Gilligan
If I get you tipsy, do you mind if I fill him in?

How yah doin'? Yeah, yeah, wat's the dealy?
You can call me Willy, you can call me Billy
You can call me whatever you'd like, no really
Just don't call me up 'cause I got a million

Dollars in the bank, gotta be frank
Captain hook chicks quick to make you walk the plank
Pirates of the Caribbean, I ain't bein' robbed
For my dividends, for not seein' it comin'

I keep movin' and runnin'
I keep shootin' and gunnin'
I'm holdin' it down, I ain't foolin' around
Will.i.am bring the heat in your town

 And any minute I'll be rollin' through
So get ready, so get ready
And any minute I'll be comin' through
So get ready, so get ready

'Cause here I come, get ready 'cause here I come

Get ready 'cause here I come

Get ready 'cause here I come
Get ready 'cause here I come

Shittin' on the world
Fuck you bitches!
Baby, baby when you're looking deep in my eyes
I know you're seeing past my make up
Into the little girl that used to hide out and cry
When her parents fought, tryin' to be strong

You can see the hurt in me, the cover ups so secretly
And all that I aspire to be, you see, you see
You know who I really am, no entourage or caravan
And do you even give a damn, about all that and tell me

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want grow older with
Baby, I'll give you all that I got

See, I don't mean to scare you now or push you away
'Cause I'm not tryin' to rush anything
But when I look into your eyes I'm not scared to say
I'll sit near you, I'm in the picture too

Like a happy family tree, we're together constantly
This could be eventually, we'll see, we'll see
But all that I have got to know is with me baby will you grow
Through sun and rain and heavy snow, oh, tell me so now, baby

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want grow older with
Baby, I'll give you all that I got

It's as simple as one and two, I'm in love with you
And three and four, you're all I adore
To the seven and eight, see I've been making mistakes
'Cause when you're on my mind I just can't think straight

Back to the five and six, I'm all in the mix
And I'm all into you Without the lipstick
Without the L'Oreal you remain the same, angel
That I fell for, for real, for real

Would you love me if I didn't work out
Or I didn't change my natural hair?
And I could be the one you want grow older with
Baby, I'll give you all that I got

I'll give you all that I got

Don't let aah, yeah
Da, da, da, da, da, da

I just wanna be close to you

The way you look in the morning
I can see your face and your daze
The way

Your silence
Always has so to say, to say
With you my king is where I belong
Our castle is beautiful and strong

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you

How you own this body
Smoke your cigarette
Sing to me in bed the way

You hold me like you're protecting your throne
I'll be your queen we'll fit so well
Yet near me darling is where dwell

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you

You say I'm talking and laughing I'm not
Breakfast in bed, have a play pillow fight
We'll hang like homies 'cause you're best friend
I know I'm safe just as long as I feel your skin

Not that I need I'm secure with myself
Space, trust, and respect I understand well
Baby, I just see such beauty in you
That I need is being close too
If near me, darling, is where you dwell

I wanna be close to you, you, you, you
I just wanna be close to you


Da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, dat

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
Lately, I don't know
But somethings coming over me
Thoughts of stirring up
'Bout stirring up a drink or three

I'm down to go where the wind blows
So come and follow
Don't wanna leave ya, babe, leave ya, babe
So please, baby

We could fly
Up, up, up, up high
Blue sky
Up, up, up, up high

Feel the high
Come and take ride
Above the stars were going far

If you wanted to have a party
Come on everybody put down your latte
Throw your work aside and come to
Paradise

No frustration on this vacation
This destination, this correlation
No consolation, only sensation
Paradise

Where the water is so clear
That you can see your feet
Dropping coins
In my nature by the coral reef

In every natural treasures
From mother nature
We are so wealthy now, wealthy now
Tell me now

Say goodbye
Buh, buh, buh, buh-bye
To all the tries
Buh, buh, buh, buh-bye

Relax your mind
Open up a wine

And then explore
I'll show you more

If you wanted to have a party
Come on everybody put down your latte
Throw your work aside and come to
Paradise

No frustration on this vacation
This destination, this correlation
No consolation, only sensation
Paradise

Manipulative, calculative, I bet you thought

Your voice is just like magic
Baby, abracadabra, you put a spell on me
Yeah, girl, you done that voodoo
So you won't you dial up my digits
So I can talk to you

And I pick it up, I pick it up
Pick it up, I pick it up
Pick it up, I pick it up
Pick it up, I pick it up

Pick it up, I pick it up
Pick it up, I pick it up
Pick it up, I pick it up
Pick it up, I pick it up

Pick it up, I pick it up
Pick it up, I pick it up
Pick it up, I pick it up
Pick it up, I pick it up

Pick it up, I pick it up
Pick it up, I pick it up
Pick it up, I pick it up

It's crazy
How it's so hard for me to just, call you
It's like I have these feelings
But someone just keeps, holding me back

I don't know what it is
It's like my insecurities, my fears
I just gotta know
That your gonna be there

I feel you missin' me
I know you missing me
'Cause I've been missin' you
Baby it's true, it's true, it's true

I know your wantin' me
Just call and talk to me
To know your needin' me
Like I need you, I need you, I need you

Ever since I was a baby girl I had a dream
Cinderella theme, crazy as it seems
Always knew that deep inside that there would come a day
When I would have to way, make so many mistakes

I couldn't comprehend as I watched it unfold
This classic story told I left it in the cold
Walking through an open door that led me back to you
Each one unlocking more of the truth

I finally stopped tripping on my youth
I finally got lost inside of you
I finally know that I needed to grow
And finally my maze has been solved

Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though it will have a different set
Something strange and new is happening

Finally
Now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him finally

I remember the beginning you already knew
I acted like a fool, just trying to be cool
Fronting like it didn't matter, I just ran away
On another face, was lost in my own space

Found what it's like to hurt selfishly
Scared to give of me, afraid to just believe
I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place
Stumbled through the nets that I had made

Finally got out of my own way
I've finally started living for today
I finally know, I needed to grow
And finally know that it must be so

Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though we will have a different set
Something strange and new is happening

Finally
Now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Gave my love to him finally

Finally, finally

Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though it will have a different set
Something beautiful is happening, is happening

Finally
Now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him finally

Oh, finally, finally, finally
Don't know what day it is
What's going on?
Is this real?
Oh no, no, no, no, no

I woke up short of breath
But I've still got a long day ahead of me
I don't know what day it is
But tell me 'cause I gotta know who to be

Is that me up in the mirror?
'Cause I thought it was somebody else
Well, it's a realization, when you find out
You don't even wanna look at yourself

Where do I go? What do I do?
Who do I turn to? I'm losing my ground
Who am I now? Where does it end?
How did it all begin? I'm losing my ground

Well, hit my feet, it time to hit the streets
And get my life back together again
Well, this place is all a masquerade
So tell me where in line can I cut in?

Downtown wandering aimlessly around
Still don't know what I'm tryin' to find
Well, you could flash all the pretty lights
In front of me, I still won't see the signs

Where do I go? What do I do?
Who do I turn to? I'm losing my ground
Who am I now? Where does it end?
How did it all begin? I'm losing my ground

Ground, losing my
I'm losing my
I'm losing my ground

Losing my, losing my
Losing my ground

Why do I do this to myself?
I'm losing my, why do I do?
Why do I do? Why do I do?

Where do I go? What do I do?
Who do I turn to? I'm loosing my ground
Who am I now? Where does it end?
How did it all begin? I'm losing my ground

Ground, I'm losing my
I'm losing my
I'm losing my ground
It's cold outside, why don't you come in?
I know, my walls are crumbling
It's late at night and lately I've been alone
But that could be changing

What you do to me, conjures up feelings
I've never felt before and your company I adore
So deliciously, gold and burgundy
Sink into me I feel so warm

I feel you, I taste you
The smoothest wine
Like velvet, can't help it
This love's divine

The moon is full, the stars are aligned
I know, just look into my eyes
It's beautiful, your skin against mine
I hope, you let your mind take flight

Under velvet skies, lover, we can fly
Away from the world, let all of our love unfurl
What a gorgeous ride, you don't have to hide
A thing from me, I am your girl

I feel you, I taste you
The smoothest wine
Like velvet, can't help it
This love's divine

I'm ready to feel you, slowly we escape
Our time we can take, we can take, we can take
I'm ready to feel you, feel you, feel you
Feel you, feel you, feel

I feel you, I taste you
The smoothest wine
Like velvet, can't help it
This love's divine

I feel you, I taste you
The smoothest wine
Like velvet, can't help it
This love's divine
Four, tres, two, uno

G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yeah
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S

We flyin' first class up in the sky
Poppin' champagne, livin' my life
In the fast lane, I won't change
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy

The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous
  
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous
  
By the glamorous, ooh the flossy flossy

Wear them gold and diamonds rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperons and limousines
Shopping for expensive things

I be on the movie screens
Magazines and boogie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine

I still go to Taco Bell
Drive through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell

After the show or after the Grammys
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin', reminiscing on days
When I had a Mustang and now I'm in

First class up in the sky
Poppin' champagne, livin' my life
In the fast lane, I won't change
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy

The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous
  
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy
The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous
  
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy

I'm talking champagne wishes, caviar dreams
You deserve nothing but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue what to do with us
I got enough money in the bank for the two of us

Plus I gotta keep enough lettuce to support your shoe fetish
Lifestyles so rich and famous, Robin Leach'll get jealous
Half a million for the stones, takin' trips from here to Rome
So if you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home

G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S, yes
G-L-A-M-O-R-O-U-S

We flyin' first class up in the sky
Poppin' champagne, livin' my life
In the fast lane, I won't change
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy

The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous
  
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy
The glamorous, the glamorous glamorous
  
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy flossy

I got problems up to here, I got people in my ear
Tellin' me these crazy things that I don't want to know

I got money in the bank and I'd really like to thank
All the fans, I'd like to thank, thank you really though

'Cause I remember yesterday when I dreamt about the days
When I'd rock on MTV, that'd be really dope
Damn, it's been a long road and the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know

  
My daddy told me so
  
He let his daughter know
  
My daddy told me so
  
He let his daughter know
The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
To be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

The path that I'm walkin', I must go alone
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full grown, full grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Like the little school mate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and Uno cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be mine
Valentine

Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers
And share our secret worlds

But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late, dark outside
I need to be with myself, and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it

First time that I saw your eyes
Boy, you looked right through me
Play it cool but I knew you knew
That cupid hit me

You got me trippin', stumblin', flippin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin in love
You got me slippin', tumblin', sinkin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love, so in love with you

Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it

Can't breath when you touch me, see
Butterflies so crazy
Whoa now, think I'm goin' down
Friends don't know what's with me

You got me trippin', stumblin', flippin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love
You got me slippin', tumblin', sinkin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love, so in love with you

She can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it

You know this ain't the first time
This has happened to me, this love sick thing
I like serious relationships
And a girl like me don't stay single for long

'Cause every time a boyfriend and I break up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug crawls right back up
And bites me and I'm back

Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it

Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it, the girl can't help it
Can't help it

You got me trippin', stumblin', flippin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love
You got me slippin', tumblin', sinkin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love, so in love with you

Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love
You got me slippin', tumblin', sinkin', fumblin'
Clumsy 'cause I'm fallin' in love, so in love with you
So in love with you, so in love with you
The smell of your skin lingers on me now

Your pedestal is falling down
Falling down, falling down
Your pedestal is falling down
Da, da, da, da, da, da

Record sales are on the mark
'Cause that's about the time the rumors start
Where all the people talking out their ass
Well, someone gotta school ya 'cause ya got no class

Well, I've paid my dues, I'm a seasoned dame
So why you gotta throw salt in my game
You hide behind the computer screens
So that you don't have to be seen
How could a person be so mean?

Who are you and what do you do?
That makes you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes

The pedestal, you put yourself on
Well, since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Probably one of them tag a longs down
For the free T-shirt 'cause you're a hanger on
You think you got my figured out
Never met me have no clue what I'm about

Maybe I got things you wish you had
You need to stop the hate and get a pen and pad
I work around the clock, so fill your smoth up with a sock
And get you head up off your jock

Tell me who you are and what your background is?
Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this?

Who are you and what do you do?
That makes you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes

The pedestal, you put yourself on
Well, since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone, gone

Your pedestal is falling down
Falling down, falling down
Your pedestal is falling down
Dum, dum, dum, dum

Your pedestal is falling down
Falling down, falling down
Your pedestal is falling down
Da, da, da, da, da, da

Tell me who you are and what your background is?
Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this?
You think I don't see you on the Internet
I've read it, don't think I won't forget

Who are you and what do you do?
That makes you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes

The pedestal, you put yourself on
Well, since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone, gone

Who are you and what do you do?
That makes you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes

The pedestal, you put yourself on
Well, since I'm breaking it down now
It's gonna collapse and be gone, gone
When I wear my Mary Jane's shoes
I can escape from a blues
The whole world seems a little bit brighter, brighter
My heavy steps get a little bit louder, louder

Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's

When I wear my Mary Jane's shoes
Just like a child under bruise
My heart and my soul they feel like I'm seven
But from my head to my toes it's like I'm in heaven, heaven

Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's, oh, no, oh, no
Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's, oh, no, oh, no

When I wear Mary Jane's shoes
I enjoy to spin the ones and twos
Music has another dimension
And I can dance with different perception

Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's, oh, no, oh, no
Whoa, my Mary Jane's
Whoa, my Mary Jane's, oh, no, oh, no

When I step into my shoes
Make the lady wanna
Really high, really low
Is caught up in the bubble

Everything is beautiful
Motherfucking, really great
When I step into my shoes
Make the lady wanna go crazy

Wanna go crazy
Wanna go crazy
Wanna go crazy

Whoa, my Mary Jane
Whoa, my Mary Jane
Whoa, my Mary Jane
Whoa, my Mary Jane
Whoa, my Mary Jane
The devil comes and I, I try to stall and I
Soon my subconscious and conscious might start to brawl
And I put up my walls, and I, and they begin to fall
As this cunning demon takes me as it voodoo doll and I

Darkness sets in as the horns start to grow
Suddenly I become somebody I don't know

Whoa, what do I do? This body's a temple of doom
Whoa, what can I say? To, oh, make all of this go away

I got many different names, but to you it's all the same
I be the crawlin' in your skin, I be the reason for your sin
I be the cunning in your charm and I be the needle in your arm
Call me once might let you got but call me twice and then
I'm gonna get ya

Mind playin' tricks on me, I'm paranoid, homie
Nobody know what I'm going through God, I'm so lonely
I know I'm loosin' it, I'm hearing, whispering
Somebody's watching me, clockin' me, hear my heart tickin'

Worshiping two Gods can get you in deep
Crystal ball show you things you're not supposed to see

Whoa, what do I do? This body's a temple of doom
Whoa, what can I say? To, oh, make all of this go away

You know I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, I'm gonna get ya
You know I'm comin' for ya, you see I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, I'm gonna get ya

You know I'm comin' for ya, you see I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, I'm gonna get ya
You know I'm comin' for ya, you see I'm comin' for ya
You know I'm gonna get ya, I said, I'm gonna get ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Ain't nobody rock it like this
Ain't nobody out there swift like this
Everywhere I go all I hear is this
Yes, I must confess

And it's true we keeps it fresh
'Cause keepin' it fresh is my main interest
Just stayin' consistent, givin' them hits
Can't hate on this

So hate if you wanna wanna
'Cause that ain't gon' make me wanna
Go stop what I'm doin' to you
Come and my beat go boom, boom

In the club they be jumpin', jumpin'
To the base that's like pumpin', pumpin'
And the girls like the speakers thumpin'
'Cause I told them to shake their humps

And any minute I'll be rollin' through
So get ready, so get ready
And any minute I'll be comin' through
So get ready, so get ready

'Cause here I come, get ready 'cause here I come

Get ready 'cause here I come

Get ready 'cause here I come
Get ready 'cause here I come

Ain't nobody rip it like me
F to the E R G I E
I rock it hardcore for my fly ladies
I rock it, yes indeed

I represent Los Angeles city
Hacienda Heights is the vicinity
Old school homies still rollin' with me
Money don't change me

So hate if you gotta, gotta
'Cause I got a lotta, lotta
Fans that I holla, holla
I'm making it hot

In the club they be jumpin', jumpin'
To the base that's like pumpin', pumpin'
And the girls like the speakers thumpin'
'Cause I told them to shake their humps

Oh, and any minute I'll be rollin' through
So get ready, so get ready
And any minute I'll be comin' through
So get ready, so get ready

'Cause here I come, get ready 'cause here I come

Get ready 'cause here I come

Get ready 'cause here I come
Get ready 'cause here I come

Will.i.am steppin' in just like a gentleman
Dressed to impress just to mess with them femines
buy you long island but my name ain't Gilligan
If I get you tipsy, do you mind if I fill him in?

How yah doin'? Yeah, yeah, wat's the dealy?
You can call me Willy, you can call me Billy
You can call me whatever you'd like, no really
Just don't call me up 'cause I got a million

Dollars in the bank, gotta be frank
Captain hook chicks quick to make you walk the plank
Pirates of the Caribbean, I ain't bein' robbed
For my dividends, for not seein' it comin'

I keep movin' and runnin'
I keep shootin' and gunnin'
I'm holdin' it down, I ain't foolin' around
Will.i.am bring the heat in your town

 And any minute I'll be rollin' through
So get ready, so get ready
And any minute I'll be comin' through
So get ready, so get ready

'Cause here I come, get ready 'cause here I come

Get ready 'cause here I come

Get ready 'cause here I come
Get ready 'cause here I come

Tell me when will you be mine?
Tell me quando, quando, quando
We can share a love divine
Please don't make me wait again

When will you say yes to me?
Tell me quando, quando, quando
You mean happiness to me
Oh my love, please tell me when

Every moment is a day
Every day seems like a lifetime
Let me show you the way
To a joy beyond compare

I can't wait a moment more, I can't wait, baby
So please tell me quando, quando
Say its me that you adore, I adore you
And then, darling, tell me when

Hey Girl you, you're my, my bella
You make my vida feel better
I'll write you lovely love letters
And sing for you acappella

My Bella, my bella
I'd die if I can't come near ya
I love you forever

Every moment is a day
And every day is like a lifetime
Let me show you the way
To a joy beyond compare

I can't wait a moment more, I can't wait either
Tell me quando, quando, quando, now
Say its me that you adore
Tell me quando, quando, quando

Baby it's time, it's time
For you to have this love of mine, this love of mine
We waited for the right time, the right time
Girl, you the love of my life

My, my bella
I'd die if I can't come near ya
My bella, my bella, you my, my bella
I love you and I feel better
I'll write you lovely love letters
And sing for you acappella
So you little Italian devils
You want to know about love?
Saraghina will tell you

If you want to make a woman happy
You rely on what you were born with
Because it is in your blood

Be Italian, be Italian
Take a chance and try to steal a fiery kiss
Be Italian, be Italian
When you hold me don't just hold me but hold this

Please be gentle, sentimental
Go ahead and try to give my cheek a pat
But be daring and uncaring
When you pinch me try to pinch me where there's fat

Be a singer, be a lover
Pick the flower now before the chance is past
Be Italian, be Italian
Live today as if it may become your last

Be a singer, be a lover
Pick the flower now before the chance is past
Be Italian, be Italian
Live today as if it may become your last
Da da da da
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection baby
To be with myself and center, clarity
Peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

The path that I'm walking I must go alone
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full grown, full grown
Fairytales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Like the little school mate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and Uno cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be my Valentine

Yes you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours too
We'll be playmates and share our secret worlds

But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late, dark outside
I need to be with myself and center, clarity
Peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
To be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

The path that I'm walkin', I must go alone
I must take the baby steps 'til I'm full grown, full grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending, do they?
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry

Like the little school mate in the school yard
We'll play jacks and Uno cards
I'll be your best friend and you'll be mine
Valentine

Yes, you can hold my hand if you want to
'Cause I want to hold yours too
We'll be playmates and lovers
And share our secret worlds

But it's time for me to go home
It's getting late, dark outside
I need to be with myself, and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I
We've got some straightenin' out to do

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It's time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
