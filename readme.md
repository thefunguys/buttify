DUBliners is a project to generate random songs.  Right now, you can choose to generate the lyrics based on albums we've scraped, or just as music.  In the future, we intend to give more options as how a song sounds.

Dubliners grew from a hackathon, so right now the code is a little scrappy.  We intend to:
 - modularise the music generating process
 - make lyrics more coherent
 - work on the web-based front-end to the app to allow people to generate and listen to songs
